	<h2>Mark Sheill - Conductor</h2>
		<p>For Mark, conducting is in his blood. Currently, he is the principal conductor/artistic director of the Zelman Symphony, the Ballarat Symphony, and the Macquarie Philiharmonia. He has also been a guest conductor for numerous other orchestras, including the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Sifonia, and the Orchestras of the State Music Champs in Melbourne and Adelaide, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>However, as awesome as it feels to conduct, Mr. Sheill is never shy about giving back to the community. Recently, Mark is developing the Regional Orchestra Weekend: a time for ensembles from across Victoria to meet and perform together. He hopes to make this event annual.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Mark trained future conductors as a frequent guest teacher of the “Masters of Conducting” program at the Melbourne Conservatory in 2015. He believes in the future of orchestra as much as he believes in the music that inspires it.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: Among some of the finest conductors, you will not want to miss Sheill conduct, with passion and dedication, the amazing Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>

<br>

	<h2>Adam Lopez - Vocalist</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows musical artists like Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, or the Coors. However, not many know or even care about the backup singers. Well, people better start, because Adam’s exceptional talent was bound to be front and center after singing backup for these very artists after a while. In fact, he has recently collaborated with Australian jazz legend James Morrison for symphonic concerts in Perth, Hobart, and Brisbane. And that was only the beginning.</p>
    <p>Lopez’s Guinness world-record smashing voice (we’re not kidding — his voice can go one note above the piano!!) has led him to multiple radio/television appearances in 6 different countries, including Japan, Italy, and the USA. Also, he delighted Townsville with his 2012 guest-star performance with the Orchestra along with artists Sean O’Boyle and James Morrison.</p>
    <p>With multiple genres ranging from rhythm & blues to pop-opera and fiery Latin, Lopez is a vocalist in every sense of the word.</p>
    
<br>

	<h2>Domenio Taraborrelli - Accordion</h2>
    <p>To everyone who thinks the accordion is lame, you haven’t heard of Domencio. From the age of 4, he’s performed with many genres on the trusty old-school piano accordion. From then, his career sky-rocketed as he’s performed at the QPAC with the Queensland Pops Orchestra and with his own Celtic Band called Murphy’s Pigs. Fun fact: this band was a runner-up at the Tamworth Golden Fiddle Awards.</p>
    <p>This well-accomplished musician has played with lots of other three-piece cabaret bands before switching to the Latin Mafia, a five-piece band. These five guys, including Domencio, play swing and Latin classics from the Rat pack era.</p>
    <p>Lastly, although he still loves his old piano accordion, Domencio is not afraid of new, as he also owns and uses a versatile midi accordion. I think it’s fair to say that this accordion player is like no other, wouldn’t you agree?</p>
    
<br>

	<h2>Raymond Yong - Conductor</h2>
	<p>Hailing from Malaysia, Raymond emigrated to Perth, Australia at the age of two. While there, he received his initial musical training and performed in public piano recitals at an early age. In high school, he found his love for conduction as he was doing so for his school orchestra and choir.</p>
    <p>The next stop for this double-threat was the University of Melbourne, where he trained and learned in the Symphony Australia Young Development Programme and became the pupil of the late John Hopkins. From there, Yong became the music director of the Victorian Youth Symphony Orchestra and Victorian Chorale. To top it off, he’s the founding director of Orchestra 21. Believe or not, this isn’t all of his accomplishments!</p>
    <p>After college, Yong’s career sky-rocketed with regular guest conducting in the Barrier Reef Orchestra since 2011 and appearances in other symphonies such as the Melbourne Chamber Orchestra, Stonnington Symphony, & Preston Symphony, to name a few. As a pianist, he’s well-known and sought after by many. He’s played solos for Chamber music events like the Linari Classic and the Huntington Festival as well as accompaniment/concertos for numerous orchestras including the Sydney Symphony, Melbourne Symphony, the West Australian and Tasmanian Symphony Orchestras.</p>
    <p>A conductor of this caliber shall not be missed and should be greatly appreciated. With Yong conducting workshops for teachers and conductors in Townsville, I think it’s safe to say that his talents are well-respected and adored by many!</p>
    
<br>

	<h2>Jennifer Bradstreet - Flute</h2>
    <p>Completing a Bachelor of Music with Honours at the Sydney Conservatorium, it was clear that Jennifer had a gift in music. From there, she moved to London in 2010 to receive her postgrad degree of performance from the Royal College of Music one year later. But that’s not all that happened. While in London, she participated in many projects with the London Symphony and was invited to the BBC Symphony Orchestral Pathway.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Bradstreet accepted a masters scholarship from the Sydney Conservatorium and will complete her studies there. She was also a finalist in the Australian Flute Competition that same year. The year after, she came in first place for the Australian Concerto & Vocal Competition….in ALL instruments. Talk about versatility; she takes this concept to another level!!</p>

	<p>Currently, Bradstreet’s an active soloist/chamber musician who performs regularly with the Barrier Reef Orchestra and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra in Sydney (freelancing since 2013). With her wealth of knowledge and experience, you can bet that you’ll be seeing her and her flute for a long, long time.</p>
    
<br>

	<h2>Leah Li - Harp</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Townsville, Leah graduated from the Queensland Conservatorium in Griffith University under the tutelage of Sebastien Lipman. From there, the harpist went on to become the principal harpist for the Australian International Symphony Orchestra Institution, Queensland Youth Symphony Orchestra, and Queensland Conservatorium Symphony and Opera Orchestras.</p>
    <p>Li spans many genres, ranging from the classical Baroque period to her favorite genre jazz, which she plans to study further. Also, she is a dedicated primary school language/instrument teacher, strong musical advocate, and beloved supporter of Townsville.</p>
